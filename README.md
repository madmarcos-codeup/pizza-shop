## Pizza Exercise

Make a Pizza class. It should have fields like pizza type (e.g., Cheese, Pepperoni, Supreme, etc.), size (Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large), and crust type (Thin, Hand-tossed, Pan).
Include accessors and an appropriate constructor.

Make a PizzaShop class. This class will have your main() method for the program.

Write a static method in the PizzaShop class to make some pizza. The method should return an ArrayList of Pizza. Have the method store a few different types of pizza in the array list before returning it.

Next, write a printPizza method that takes an ArrayList of Pizza and prints out the pizzas in the ArrayList.

In your main, call makePizza and then call printPizza
